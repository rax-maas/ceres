- [ ] Implement `SeriesSetService.isCounter` by matching configured suffixes
- [ ] Add more Flux/Mono checkpoint() operators to improve stack traces
- [ ] Enforce sanity bounds on ingested metric timestamps
- [ ] Auto-detect if ingested timestamp is either seconds or milliseconds since OpenTSDB API docs allow for either
- [ ] Add support for string "metrics"
- [ ] Extract metric name prefix and store in metric group table. For example, `diskio_iops_in_progress`, `diskio_merged_writes`, etc could be retrieved by metric group "diskio"
- [ ] Validate downsampling `timeSlotWidth` property is a multiple of largest granularity width. Also need to validate that granularity `widths` are multiples of width smaller than each.
- [ ] Fix: when querying /metadata/tenants, warning `Aggregation query used without partition key`
- [ ] Dynamic partition assignments for downsample processing
- [ ] Use custom validator to validate downsample granularities when partitionsToProcess or partitionsMappingFile is configured
- [ ] Add actuator metric of the queried time span and related behavior to help operators to know what downsample granularities are actually used by end users
- [ ] Add actuator metric of the delta between current time and downsampled timeslot. If that value grows beyond the timeslot width + processing interval then it indicates downsample processing might be running too slow
- [ ] Handle stale metadata where "staleness" probably needs to be determined by largest retention period of the downsample granularities
- [x] Metrics, especially in downsampler
- [x] Option to read partition assignments from a shared config file. The config file would contain a map of hostname to partitions to process, where hostname is the current hostname with an entry in the file. This allows for a Kubernetes StatefulSet deployment where the pod's hostname is used to index into the shared config.
- [x] Implement error handling on downsample storage
- [x] More logging throughout, such as pending downsampler logs
- [x] End to end testing of DownsampleProcessor
- [x] Implement OpenTSDB ingest HTTP API
- [x] Implement simple query of downsampled data
